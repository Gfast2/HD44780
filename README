Cross-platform library for LCDs with HD44780-compatible controller.
The library is designed to allow you to write drivers for your hardware
platform without rewriting the library itself. There is only STM32F10x
driver at the time. Originally, this was direct port of LiquidCrystalExt
library for Arduino, from C++ classes to plain C functions and structures.
